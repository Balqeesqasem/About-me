# I will complete a summary of what I read

## HTML

* Links :

Links are created using the (a) element.
 Users can click on anything between the opening (a)) tag and the closing (a) tag. You specifywhich page you want to link to using the href attribute.


You can include a link like through this statemant :

* Relative Link Type:

  1. Same Folder.
  2. Child Folder
  3. Grandchild Folder
  4. Parent Folder
  5. GrandParent Folder

  #### You can open links in a new window
  #### You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
  #### You can use the id attribute to target elements within  a page that can be linked to.


* *On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the sit into a new folder.
 Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories.*

 ## CSS

 I read about :
  
  * position:absolute
  * position:relative
  * position:fixed
  * float
  
  
  ### Screen Sizes : 
  
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

* A Fixed Width Layout (Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.)
* A grid-Based Layout (Grids help create professional and flexible designs.)


## Javascript :

Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.
 
 * Function :
 Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

we have :
 * named functions.
 * anonymous function.

 How to declare function :

* The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used within that function. This is known as the variable's scope.


- Local variables .
- Global variables .

## Pair programming :

Pair programming involves:
 1. Driver 

 manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. 

 2. Navigator

 uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.
