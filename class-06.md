### Objects:
Set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world.

* IN AN OBJECT:

- Property(variable)
- Method(function)


* Document Object Model (DOM):

- The DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure this model using a DOM tree.
- When the browser loads a web page, it creates a model of the page in memory.
- DOM also defines methods and properties to access and update each object in this model


* Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:
1. Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.
2. Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.

* ACCESS THE ELEMENTS:
1. select an individual element
    * get ElementByld ()
    * querySe1ector ()

 2. select multiple elements:   
    * getElementsByClassName()
    * getElementsByTagName()
    * querySelectorAll()

 3. move from one element node to a related element node :
    * parentNode
    * previousSibl ing / nextSibl ing
    * firstChild / lastChild
